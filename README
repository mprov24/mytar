Instructions:
    ./mytar [ctxvS[f tarfile]] [file1 [ file2 [...] ] ]

Notes:
    - mytar.c:  Handles command line arguments, as well as shared code
                between list mode and extract mode.

    - tarCreate.c, tarList.c, tarExtract.c: exclusive code for each main 
                                            tar mode 

    - tools.c:  Contains safe mallocs, string operations, and some other useful
                math defs
